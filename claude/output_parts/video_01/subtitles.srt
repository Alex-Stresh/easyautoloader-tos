1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
In the red

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,640
corner, we had

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,960
the young and

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,280
unchunnaged.

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,450
So, Mick, you're

6
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,500
going down in

7
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,549
the fourth.

8
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,000
Is that clear?

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,599
Just make sure

10
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,199
he doesn't kill

11
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,800
me. What a

12
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,400
fucking force.

13
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,550
So, give it

14
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,900
up for the

15
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,250
bone crunching.

16
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,449
One punch machine

17
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,099
gun.

18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And Mick!

19
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Oh, no!

20
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Oh, no!

21
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,800
And then the

22
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,600
other corner...

23
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,942
Now, now he

24
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:29,885
looks like a

25
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:30,828
fanfucker.

26
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,339
Well, he's a

27
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,479
fanfucker, but he's

28
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,619
dirty and he's

29
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:34,759
dangerous.

30
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,200
Come on! Don't

31
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,400
not bend!

32
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
All right, it

33
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
is.

34
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,857
I'm trying to

35
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:42,714
look at the

36
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:43,571
fan.

37
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ritz!

38
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I get ready!

39
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
To roll!

40
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh, run, now!

41
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Ritz!

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,818
Do you realize

43
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:23,636
I've just done

44
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:24,454
fucking 40 grand,

45
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:25,272
damn you?

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
What's the fucking

47
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
correct?

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,500
I'll make it

49
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,000
up to you.

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,750
All right, fuck

51
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,500
you, let me

52
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,250
break top.

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,750
I'll make it

54
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,500
up to you.

55
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,250
I promise, stay

56
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,000
in on me.

57
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,285
Oh, fucking pipe

58
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,571
is putty in

59
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:36,857
it.

60
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,857
Well, thanks for

61
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:39,714
the tip, break

62
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:40,571
top.

63
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
You're so new,

64
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
fucking fringe.

65
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,750
If I throw

66
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,500
a dog a

67
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,250
bone, I don't

68
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,000
want to know.

69
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,599
It tastes good

70
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,199
or not.

71
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,818
You stop me

72
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:47,636
again whilst I'm

73
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:48,454
walking and I'll

74
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:49,272
catch you.

75
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Fucking jagas all.
